 Uses little endian byte ordering

 All distances are in meters

 arrays have used positions moved to the beginning - Rates, kHz, DepthBT 
 Indexes for these arrays refer to these compacted positions - PrimaryTrans, SecondaryTrans, Transducer

 PrimaryTrans and SecondaryTrans will override any setting of TBssRec.Select 

 TXYRect - record Left, Top, Right, Bottom of double

 TBssString - 64 bytes of null terminated Unicode 1.0. This is UCS-2LE or UTF-16LE without surrogates.

 TVer - U16 version number where Major is thousands, Minor is hundreds, Revision is ones. 

 Timetag - double is in days since midnight 12/30/1899 local time. Fraction is part of a day since midnight. 

 Bool is written with false = 0, true = 1.  But read with C method where true = any non-zero value

 Types with numbers show the number of bits.

 SdiDepth and SmartSurvey can read files up to 4 GB.  While some previous files approach that size, newly written
files should not exceed 2 GB, since many EOF, seek and file position language implementations return signed numbers.
